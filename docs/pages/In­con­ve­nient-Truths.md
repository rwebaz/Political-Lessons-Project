## Filtering Your Life

**White Su­premacy** is rather but a fil­ter through which you may view the world relativistically to the point all progress stops.

A sort of retrograde motion that gives the appearance of movement, but in reality actually digresses.

## Flamboyant Relativism

"Trumpian lies are noth­ing more than in­tox­i­cat­ing in­stru­ments to bran­dish about in times of in­con­ve­nient truth."~ Jason Parham

## Discernible Reality

"The judicious study of a discernible reality in politics is a fruitless endeavor because 2/3rd's of the entire voting population marks their ballots with their gut, not their brain."~ Karl Rove

## Relativism v Rationalism

Do fantasmas really exist?

Should we follow empirical science when actually governing, as opposed to NOT following empirical science when campaigning?

## Religion in Politics

1:7383 State Congress members report "No Religion" ( Ernie Chambers, Ky )
