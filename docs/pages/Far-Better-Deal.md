## The People's Platform Plus The Better Deal

Taking the best aspects of both platforms

***

### Access to medical care for all

- Healthcare makes up approx. 1/5th of our entire $20 Trillion USD economy

### Medicare Expansion

- Some states did NOT participate in the original Medicare expansion offered by then President O'bama.

- Arizona was one of those states that DID choose to participate under the guidance of then Governor Brewer .

- What were the reasons given by the state governors at the time that did not participate?

- Primarily the fact that Federal funding to help cover the expansion costs would eventually be phased out, and then the state would have to pick up the tab from state treasury revenues.

- Which Governor Jan countered with an "Executive Tax" on hospital emergency rooms

### Medicaid

### Social Security

### Dentistry

## Better Jobs

We owe our highly skilled labor force more benefits

***

### Infrastructure Spending

- $1 Trillion ( that's 1,000 billion ) USD

- Start immediately on the top 10% of most likely to fail bridges, roads, canals, dams, and waterways

- Funded by premium, non-callable, 30 year tax-free GO's with a silver sinking fund

- 1,000 billion X 1/30th = $33 billion / $15 per ounce = 2 billion ounces annually

- 5 cent per gallon gasoline tax + 1 cent per kilowatt hour electric tax

- Natural gas = EXEMPT

- 2018 + 30 = 2048

- $1,000 billion X 1% coupon = $500 million semi-annual interest payments

### Minimum Wage - Financial Transaction Tax

- Fund it with a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT), commonly known as the "risk" or "speculation" tax

- At the time of purchase, if the expected Net Present Value (NPV) exceeds the "cost of capital"

- At the time of sale, extracted from the "gross proceeds of sale" if a gain ( capital gains tax )
