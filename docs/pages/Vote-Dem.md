Wednesday, November 7th, #2018 ...

"A Day That Will Live In Infamy!"~ Pres. Franklin D Roosevelt  ( D - NY )

## Sample Letter To Voters

Hello Fellow Voter and Arizona Citizen:

If your official Arizona voter ID card does not say **DEM** inside a big box by now ...

Then, can you still vote for me in the August #2018 Primary Election?

Can you nominate me?

Sure can!

If you are an **Independent**, or a **Democrat**, or a member of any of the other **Minor Parties**, or have **No Party** affiliation at all, then you can still nominate me.

To participate in this **Nominating Petition Drive** you must be a **Citizen of Arizona** who is registered to vote in the State of Arizona either as a member of the **Democratic Party** or as a person who is registered with **No Party** preference, or as an **Independent** as to party preference, or *who is registered with a political party that is not qualified for representation on the ballot*.

**Note**. The deadline to register to vote in Arizona for the **Democratic Primary** is July 30th, #2018.

## GOPs

Some people think **GOPs** cannot nominate me for Arizona Governor.

But, you can! ( I was once in your shoes, too! )

If you go to [ServiceArizona.com](https://www.servicearizona.com){:target="_blank"} and order up a new official voter ID card.

There is no cost to do this.

Just mark your party affiliation as **DEM**.

You can always change back before the general election if you wish to do so.

As long as you do so **BEFORE** (30) days preceding the Mid-Term election on November 7th, #2018.

Or, you can just vote your own conscience from the privacy of your own living room, or kitchen table.

Be sure to check the box "Send Me An Early Ballot".

There is no need to stand in line to vote come August of #2018.

You will be eligible to vote in the Democratic Primary for Governor of Arizona if you take these steps.

And, you will be able to mark that ballot next to my name.

Please consider making a matching [$5](http://apps.azsos.gov/equal/){:target="_blank"} contribution to the **Arizona Clean Election Commission** when you designate your nomination for Governor online at the Arizona Secretary of State ( Michele Reagan ) Election Website.

Thank you.

Your contribution and your nomination will set in motion a great wheel of forward progress for out state, for our (15) individual counties of Arizona, and for our 6 million ( and, still growing ) citizens of Arizona.
